To pick up with this project and better follow the code description below, a general overview of the data directories and scripts is provided here. Scripts with names like main*.py are the ones being executed. Code samples in this report will also be limited to snippets from main files, excluding function definitions with doc strings. One directory, which is also the one linked to github, has all the scripts, including the main*.py ones. Whenever a python script is referenced, it can be found in this directory. For using this code on new data, one needs to primarily edit P["outputPath"] and P["inputPath"] in MUA_init.py and possibly various settings in MUA_const.py.
To built on top of this code, one should understand the structure behind saving script outputs as well. There must be a base directory . that has subdirectories of the structure ./output_*/where the asterisk indicates the dataset from which the output is generated, eg. ./output_gwendata_lowthr. In there, a subdirectory MUA_output should be created. Importantly, ./output_*/MUA_output must be set as the value for P["outputPath"] in MUA_init.py. Any major sub-analysis on the specific dataset should have a directory in this base ./output_*/.
